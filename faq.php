                <h2>What is Future?</h2>
                <p>Future is a two-day tech conference and hackathon crafted specifically for teenagers. Attendees will hear talks from some of the most inspirational teenagers in the tech industry, as well as the opportunity to hear from some local startups about life in the tech industry. Attendees will then also be able to get their hands dirty by doing some proper coding and designing real apps and websites, giving them invaluable experience and skills that will be of value for years to come. </p>
              
                <h2>What is a hackathon?</h2>
                <p>A hackathon can be described as an innovation marathon. They take place all around the world in every industry. Attendees or 'hackers' are split into teams and given a theme (in this case Education). They'll then come up with an idea on how to improve something based on that theme using technology. For example, in the theme of Education, attendees might program a revision app or an app that helps teachers. At the end of a hackathon, teams pitch their ideas to a group of judges then prizes are awarded to the team with the best project.</p>

                <h2>Is it legal?!</h2>
                <p>Yes, absolutely! The word hack is often associated with cybercriminals who steal companies' data, but this is not the case. To 'hack' something just means to use something in a clever way or to prototpye something very quickly.</p>

                <h2>Who's organising it?</h2>
                <p>Future2016 is being organised exclusively by a team of four teenagers from Belfast. Future was founded by Adam Flanagan, a 14 year old from Belfast. He formed a team of three other teenagers: Jake Lowry (14), Olivia Copeland (15) and James McDaid (15). </p>

                <h2>What if I can't code?</h2>
                <p>No problem. The entire point of the hackathon is to teach you how to code! We'll have coding experts on site to give you some guidance, and don't forget that you'll also be working in teams of 5 so there'll be other people with more coding experience. You'll also be able to work on other things such as design and the pitch of the app/website itself. </p>
