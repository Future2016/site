                <p>Future2016 was conceived by Adam Flanagan, a 14 year old designer and developer who became frustrated by the lack of tech events aimed at teens. He teamed up with several other teenagers including Igor Silin and Jake Lowry.</p>
                <p>With a wide-ranging list of speakers that includes people from TIME magazine's most influential teens to the man who's dreaming up the future of eCommerce, Future2016 looks set to be a fantastic event. </p>
                <p>By using a unique model and organising a tech conference around a hackathon, we ensure that attendees get the most from this experience. Not only will they be able to develop their skills first-hand by 'hacking' together a product, but they will also receive talks from some of the leading people in the technology industry today.</p>
                <p>The ultimate aim of the event is not only to inspire the next generation of tech leaders, but also to make teens see code as more than lines and squiggles on a screen and appreciate it for the magic that it is.</p>
